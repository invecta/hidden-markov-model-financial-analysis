# Problem Statement: Hidden Markov Model for Financial Analysis

## Executive Summary

The financial markets exhibit complex, non-linear behavior with hidden states that traditional analysis methods often fail to capture. This project addresses the challenge of predicting stock price movements and identifying market regimes using Hidden Markov Models (HMMs), providing a more sophisticated approach to financial market analysis.

## Problem Definition

### 1. Market Volatility and Hidden States

**Challenge**: Financial markets operate in different "regimes" or states that are not directly observable:
- **Bull Market**: Characterized by rising prices, high confidence
- **Bear Market**: Characterized by falling prices, low confidence  
- **Sideways Market**: Characterized by range-bound trading, uncertainty

**Traditional Approach Limitations**:
- Linear models assume constant relationships
- Technical indicators provide lagging signals
- Fundamental analysis doesn't capture regime changes
- Most models ignore the hidden state structure

### 2. Prediction Accuracy Issues

**Current Problems**:
- Low prediction accuracy in volatile markets
- Inability to adapt to changing market conditions
- Lack of confidence intervals for predictions
- No understanding of market state transitions

**Impact**:
- Poor investment decisions
- Increased risk exposure
- Missed opportunities
- Inadequate risk management

### 3. Data Complexity

**Challenges**:
- High-dimensional financial data
- Non-stationary time series
- Noise and outliers
- Multiple correlated assets

**Traditional Solutions**:
- Simple moving averages
- Basic regression models
- Rule-based systems
- Manual analysis

## Proposed Solution: Hidden Markov Models

### Why HMMs for Financial Analysis?

1. **State Identification**: HMMs can identify hidden market states
2. **Transition Modeling**: Capture how markets move between states
3. **Probabilistic Predictions**: Provide confidence measures
4. **Adaptive Learning**: Update models as new data arrives
5. **Multi-dimensional**: Handle multiple assets simultaneously

### Key Advantages

- **Regime Detection**: Automatically identify market states
- **Transition Probabilities**: Understand state change likelihood
- **Uncertainty Quantification**: Provide prediction confidence
- **Real-time Adaptation**: Update models with new data
- **Interpretability**: Clear state-based explanations

## Research Questions

### Primary Questions
1. Can HMMs effectively identify hidden market states in stock price data?
2. How accurate are HMM-based predictions compared to traditional methods?
3. What are the transition patterns between different market states?
4. How can HMM results be visualized for practical decision-making?

### Secondary Questions
1. Which stocks show the most predictable state patterns?
2. How do different time periods affect state identification?
3. What is the optimal number of states for different assets?
4. How stable are the identified states over time?

## Objectives
